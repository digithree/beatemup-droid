## Beet 'em up
A beetroot music/rythym puzzle game for android, developed in 2 days during the Global Game Jam event, 2015 (January 23rd - 25th).


### Installation

Simply go to the bin folder and download the BeatEmUp.apk file to your Android device, once downloaded you can install it.
Please note you will need to allow installations from 'Unverified sources', or similar, in order to proceed with the installation.

Disclaimer: We promise not to break anything on purpose, but please note this game is provided as-is (currently version is the Global Game Jam submission), you install and use at your own risk.


### Playing The Game

By placing portals in the farmer's field you guide a travelling "doodad", hitting the beets to create a beat. You complete the level by figuring out how to play the musical beat using only the vegetable beets and spacetime portals provided. Touch the light blue left most portal button to create the entry portal. Touch anywhere in the field to place the entry portal. Touch again to place the exit portal somewhere else. There are three kinds of portal exits: one that speeds time up, one that sets time back to normal and one that slows time down. You'll need to use these in later fields. Touch a beet in the field to hear what it sounds like. Touch the question mark to hear the musical beat sequence again. Touching the bin clears all portals from the field. Touching the "X" button lets you choose a portal to be removed. Finally, press play to release the travelling doodad and hear your beets! Have fun and thanks for playing.

**Bug note:** if the screen goes blank you'll have to restart the game, wasn't enough time at the game jam to fix this!
